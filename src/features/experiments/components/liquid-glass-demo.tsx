/* A liquid-glass button, sitting on three lines of type, that you can drag across them.

   WebGL cannot read the pixels behind its own canvas, so a shader can never refract the
   real page. The honest way round it is to own the backdrop: this canvas draws the type
   itself, in the page's own colour, and the button is a rounded-rect signed distance field
   shaded on top of it. Everything the glass does to the text is real sampling, not a
   painted highlight.

   What the canvas outputs is premultiplied — what it adds, plus what it blocks — rather
   than a finished opaque image, so the surface underneath is the real one and the demo has
   no rectangle of its own on the page. The one colour it does need is that surface, passed
   in as a uniform: the glass has to know what it is frosting.

   The edge is where all of it happens. The distance field gives a bevel profile, the bevel
   gives a normal, and the normal gives three things at once: a refracted sample of the
   type underneath, taken once per wavelength so the rim fringes the way thick glass does;
   a Fresnel weight; and a reflection of a procedural environment that the Fresnel drives
   to 1 at grazing angles. That grazing reflection *is* the bright edge — there is no rim
   term anywhere in the shader.

   Liquid is the other half. The button trails the pointer on a spring, stretches along the
   axis it is travelling and thins across it, and its boundary keeps wobbling for a moment
   after you let go. Press it and it squashes, and the glass thickens under your finger. */
