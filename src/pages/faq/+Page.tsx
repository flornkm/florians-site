      question: "What are your capabilities as an AI assistant?",
      answer:
        "As an AI assistant, I can help with a wide range of tasks including answering questions, generating content, providing recommendations, explaining complex topics, and assisting with problem-solving. I'm designed to understand natural language, maintain context throughout conversations, and provide helpful, accurate information across various domains of knowledge.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you process my questions?",
      answer:
        "I process your questions using natural language understanding models that analyze the text to determine your intent. I don't have personal experiences or emotions, but I'm trained on vast datasets to recognize patterns and generate appropriate responses. When you ask a question, I work to understand the context and provide the most relevant and helpful answer possible.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can you remember our previous conversations?",
      answer:
        "Within a single session, I can maintain context and refer back to our previous exchanges. This helps me provide more coherent and relevant responses as our conversation progresses. However, I don't permanently store conversations or build a persistent memory of users between different sessions unless specifically designed to do so by the platform I'm integrated with.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you handle information you're uncertain about?",
      answer:
        "When I encounter information I'm uncertain about, I try to acknowledge my limitations and be transparent. I avoid making definitive claims on topics where my knowledge might be limited or outdated. In such cases, I might suggest seeking additional information from more authoritative sources or indicate the boundaries of my understanding on the subject.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are your limitations?",
      answer:
        "I have several limitations. My knowledge has a training cutoff date, so I may not have information about recent events. I can't browse the web independently, run code, or access external systems unless specifically integrated with those capabilities. I also don't have personal experiences, emotions, or consciousness. There are certain sensitive topics I'm designed to avoid or handle with care to ensure I'm providing helpful and responsible assistance.",
