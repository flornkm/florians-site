# Building in Public

There is something uncomfortable about sharing work before it is polished. Every instinct tells you to wait, to refine, to present only the best version. But some of the most meaningful connections come from showing the messy middle.

## Why It Matters

When you build in public, you invite people into your process. They see the false starts, the pivots, the moments of doubt. And paradoxically, that vulnerability builds more trust than any perfectly curated portfolio ever could.

## The Practice

It starts small. Share a screenshot of something you are working on. Write a short post about a problem you solved. Document a decision you made and why. Over time, these small acts compound into a body of work that tells a richer story than any finished product alone.

## What I Have Learned

The feedback you get from sharing early is invaluable. Not just the constructive criticism, but the unexpected connections. People reach out because they are solving similar problems. Collaborations form. Opportunities appear that you never would have found behind closed doors.

Building in public is not about self-promotion. It is about contributing to a shared body of knowledge and finding your people along the way.
