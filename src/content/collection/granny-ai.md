# Granny AI

An experimental AI chatbot made for shopping in an 48h sprint in university.

In our 48 hour university sprint, [Anton Stallbörger](https://stallboerger.com) and myself wanted to make use of OpenAI's GPT-3 API to create a chatbot that could help shoppers find products they were looking for.

At the same time, we wanted to create a visually appealing interface that would make the chatbot feel more personal and engaging.
This is where the idea of using a Granny interface came from. Grandmas usually give the best advice, so from a "branding" perspective,
this was exactly what we were looking for. It also was a fun way of grabbing attention – a Granny and an AI, what the f*ck?

In the end, we have created a quick user interface that allowed to choose between different clothing options.
We intentially avoided using just text-based input as this would have been boring. Instead, we allowed users to use an odometer-like selector for
the price and a category on the bottom of the screen.
