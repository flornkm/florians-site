# Reimagining i18n for developers

One file format that is interoperable between multiple apps, built on git's core principles.

![inlang redesign](/images/inlang/inlang-redesign.webp)

inlang enables developers to easily setup and use one file format for their translations. In contrast to other translation tools which use databases, inlang is fully file-based and agnostic – making it significantly easier to integrate into any tech stack.

## Marketplace

My focus at inlang was building the marketplace and mini-apps for easier project management.


```florians-site/src/content/work/inlang.mdx
{
  …,
  "properties": {
    …,
    "icon": {
      "type": "string",
      "format": "uri",
      "description": "Icon URL."
    },
    "gallery": {
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "string",
        "format": "uri"
      },
      "description": "Image URLs for gallery display."
    },
    "displayName": {
      "type": "object",
      "description": "Localized display names.",
      "additionalProperties": { "type": "string" }
    },
  …    
}
```

We transformed inlang.com from a simple landing page into a comprehensive marketplace with manifests that defined product metadata, integrating everything into one central hub.

I refactored the markdown parsing system to remark/rehype and introduced custom lit web components that work across all frameworks, giving users the simplicity of markdown with interactive components.

## Installation wizard

To simplify onboarding, I built a platform where users can open their inlang files and install products with just a few clicks.

By early 2023, inlang's repository had accumulated over 9,000 commits, reached more than 850 stars, and attracted nearly 50 contributors. Given my sole design background, I was able to get a lot of hands-on Javascript and Typescript experience.
