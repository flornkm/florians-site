# Personal sites

Personal sites differ fundamentally from portfolios. While portfolios showcase specific work and skills with a professional audience in mind, personal sites offer creative freedom and self-expression without constraints.

Portfolios are curated collections of work samples optimized for job opportunities. They follow industry standards, highlight expertise, and are tailored to potential employers or clients.

In contrast, personal sites serve as digital gardens where you can experiment, share thoughts, document journeys, and connect with like-minded individuals. They don't need to follow conventional structures or focus solely on career advancement.

Your personal site can evolve alongside youâ€”featuring side projects, blog posts, photography, or anything that represents who you are beyond your professional identity. It's a space that remains authentically yours regardless of career changes or industry trends.

## The freedom to experiment

Personal sites provide a playground for trying new technologies, design approaches, and content formats. You can rebuild your site with different frameworks, experiment with unconventional layouts, or test interactive features without worrying about professional implications. This experimentation often leads to skill development and creative breakthroughs that benefit your professional work.

## Building genuine connections

Unlike social media platforms where algorithms determine reach, personal sites attract visitors who are genuinely interested in your thoughts and work. The people who find and bookmark your site are more likely to become meaningful connections, collaborators, or friends. These organic relationships often prove more valuable than networking through traditional professional channels.

## Ownership and longevity

Personal sites give you complete control over your content and presentation. While social media platforms change their algorithms, policies, or even disappear entirely, your personal site remains stable. You own the domain, the content, and the relationship with your audience. This ownership becomes increasingly valuable as digital platforms consolidate and change.

## What to include

Personal sites thrive on authenticity rather than polish. Consider including:

- Work-in-progress projects and learning experiments
- Personal reflections on industry trends or life experiences
- Collections of things you find interesting or inspiring
- Documentation of your learning journey and failures
- Creative projects that don't fit professional categories
- Links and recommendations that reflect your interests

## Beyond the resume

While portfolios answer "What can you do?", personal sites explore "Who are you?" They reveal your thought processes, interests outside work, and how you approach problems. This deeper context often resonates more strongly with potential collaborators than a polished portfolio ever could.

The best personal sites feel like conversations with their creators. They invite exploration, spark curiosity, and leave visitors with a genuine sense of the person behind the work.
