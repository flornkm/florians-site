# Effortless meeting notes

Sona captures conversations and meetings, delivering insights that matter most to you. It consists of iOS and watchOS apps backed by powerful infrastructure to process audio and extract valuable information.

When taking walks with friends, chatting in the car, or simply having a call, we don't want to write down, we want to actively remember and talk to our conversation. Sona's idea was simple: Capturing these fleeting moments and making them accessible with the help of AI. Given that we started this project in January of 2024, there weren't a lot of AI native solutions out there and most iOS apps we were able to find used Apple's integrated iOS voice to text feature.

## Interactions & Animations

We put a lot of care into the micro-interactions and animations to make Sona feel polished and delightful to use.

## Rive Animations

We used Rive to create smooth, interactive animations that bring the app to life while keeping performance buttery smooth on iOS.

## Launch

Sona launched successfully on ProductHunt, reaching nearly 10,000 users in its first month. While we're working on new projects in the meantime, we still see a static increase in our user count.
