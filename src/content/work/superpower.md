# Unlocking better healthcare for everyone

Superpower is a health intelligence platform, offering a various range of tests to prevent illnesses, and help its users building great habits to become the best version of themselves.

[Nils Eller](https://x.com/nilseller) and myself worked with Superpower throughout 2025 to improve the overall UX throughout their platform.

Superpower offers prodcuts for users to track their health via biomarkers. Samples get turned into data which is the foundation of what makes Superpower so great:
Turning too complex for average joe's understanding test results to offer users insights into their actual health. This is mainly accomplished by:
- Using the data to feed an AI doctor giving you helpful insights
- Offering relations between different test results based on timestamps
- Telling the user not only what's wrong, but also offering solutions in form of supplements, prescriptions, and custom protocols
