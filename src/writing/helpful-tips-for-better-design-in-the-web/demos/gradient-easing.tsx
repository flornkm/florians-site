/* Figure for "Ease your gradients" in the Unpopular tips article.

   A scrim over a photo, with the ramp that made it standing beside the card. Pressing the ramp
   eases it.

   The story usually told about this is that fading `to transparent` goes through transparent
   *black* and leaves a grey band. That was a Safari bug and it has been fixed for years —
   gradients interpolate in premultiplied alpha, so the colour comes out right. What is still
   wrong is the shape. A linear ramp is still falling when it hits zero, and that kink in the
   slope draws a horizontal line across the picture exactly where the scrim ends. Nothing in the
   photograph is at that height. The edge belongs to the gradient.

   The figure is built on the second way of writing that curve. Rather than holding the stops in
   place and bending their alpha, it holds every alpha exactly where it is — evenly spaced, top to
   bottom — and moves the stops instead. Even spacing *is* the linear ramp. Pull each stop to where
   the ease reaches its alpha and the same list becomes the eased one, bunched down at the dark end
   and thinned out toward the top where the curve flattens.

   Which makes the control and the effect one operation. There is a single number in this file that
   animates, the handles ride it, the gradient is rebuilt from the same positions on the same frame,
   and the two cannot drift. Nothing enters, nothing leaves, nothing cross-fades — stacking two
   black scrims and dissolving between them would wash pale through the middle of every transition,
   since two half-opacity blacks composite lighter than one full one.

   The photo is load-bearing as well, and it is cropped at source rather than framed at render
   time: the file is already the exact 3:2 window the card shows, kept at the crop's native pixels
   so nothing is resampled twice on the way to the screen. The cottage centres it and the cattle
   straddle the middle, which is the composition; what the figure needs from it is the water under
   them. The ramp — and the edge at the top of it — plays out over that one continuous mid-tone
   field. Over the forest that fills the original the two ramps would be near enough
   indistinguishable, which is the trap this figure has to avoid: a texture busy enough hides the
   very thing being shown. */

// Well short of full black. At 0.85 over water this dark the bottom of the ramp was arriving at
// something indistinguishable from solid, so the scrim read as a slab with a fade stuck on top of
// it rather than as one gradient. The caption still clears its background comfortably: the loch
// under it is already deep navy, so the scrim is insurance rather than the whole contrast budget.
const SCRIM_ALPHA = 0.72;
// Enough stops that each straight segment is shorter than the curvature it stands in for. Fewer
// and the sampling itself starts showing as faint bands, which is the bug being fixed here.
const STOP_COUNT = 16;
/** px. The handle track insets by half of this so the end stops stay centred on 0% and 100%. */
const HANDLE_SIZE = 16;
// px. The stop's own value, shown inside the ring the way a real gradient editor shows it. The
// two sizes leave a 2px ring: enough to hold the swatch off whatever it is sitting on, thin
// enough that the value stays the thing you read rather than the frame around it.
const HANDLE_CORE_SIZE = 12;
// Every other stop gets a handle. All seventeen drive the CSS — dropping the gradient to nine
// stops nearly halves the improvement this figure exists to show, taking the kink where the eased
// ramp lands from 39% of the linear one's up to 54% — but seventeen handles on a bar this narrow
// read as a zipper rather than as something you could grab.
// Must divide STOP_COUNT: anything else leaves the last gap short, and the linear state has to
// read as evenly spaced or the eased one has nothing to be uneven against.
const HANDLE_STRIDE = 4;

/** Fixed for the life of the figure. Only where these sit ever changes. */
const STOP_ALPHAS = Array.from(
  { length: STOP_COUNT + 1 },
  (_, index) => SCRIM_ALPHA * (1 - index / STOP_COUNT),
);

// alpha(p) = A * (1 - p)^n, and the exponent is the whole ease. A cosine arrives flat at *both*
// ends, and the flat end at the bottom is what was building the slab: the ramp sat on its darkest
// value instead of leaving it. Flatness is only worth anything at the top, where the scrim has to
// vanish into the photograph without drawing a line. At the bottom it terminates against the card
// edge, where there is nothing to blend into and nothing for a change in slope to show against, so
// this curve starts moving there immediately — 1.6x the linear ramp's rate off the bottom.
// Above 1 is what keeps the top flat; 1.6 lands the kink there at 35% of the linear ramp's.
const EASE_EXPONENT = 1.6;

// Inverting that for each evenly spaced alpha: the position at which the curve has already fallen
// that far. Both ends are fixed points, so the ramp is pinned while everything between it slides.

// px. Quadrant of the transparency checker drawn behind each swatch. Sized so an odd number of
// tiles spans the core (12 / 4 = 3): an even count puts a seam through the middle and lands half
// squares on the edge, which scallops the circle and throws the ring's padding out of true.

// Explanatory rather than operational: this is clicked a handful of times, not hundreds, so it can
// take longer than the sub-300ms a real control would get. The bounce is small enough to read as
// weight settling rather than as a flourish. No stagger — the redistribution staggers itself, since
// the middle stops barely move and the ones near the ends travel furthest.
