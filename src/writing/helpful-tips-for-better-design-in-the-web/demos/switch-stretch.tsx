/* Figure for "Stretch your switches while they are held" in the Unpopular tips article.

   One switch, nothing around it, because the whole thing is one `:active` rule on the knob: while
   the pointer is down it stretches towards the end it is about to travel to. No state, no spring
   library, no gesture handler — press and the control gives, release and it snaps back.

   The track never changes size, so nothing next to it can be pushed around. The knob is pinned to
   both ends of it (3px from the side it rests on, 29px from the other) rather than translated,
   which means its width is simply whatever those two offsets leave over: pulling the far one in
   to 20px both elongates it and points it in the right direction, in one property. A translated
   knob would need a second, competing scale to do the same, and would smear its rounded caps
   doing it.

   The knob is a pill before you ever touch it — 72×32 track, 3px of padding, so it rests at 40
   across a 26 tall body and goes to 49 while held. A circle that only becomes a pill on press
   reads as a glitch; a pill that leans a little further into the gap it is about to cross reads as
   the thing giving way under the finger. */
