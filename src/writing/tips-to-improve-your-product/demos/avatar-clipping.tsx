/* Figure for "Clip your avatars" in the Unpopular tips article. Dressed as a real members
   panel, so the technique is shown where it actually gets used rather than on a blank stage.

   The separation between two overlapping avatars is a *hole*, not a ring in the background
   colour. Each avatar is an SVG whose mask subtracts the neighbour's circle, grown by the gap,
   out of its own body — so whatever sits behind the stack shows through the crescent. That is
   what the Backdrop checkbox is for: with a plain surface behind them a painted-on ring and a
   real cutout look identical, and the moment there is anything else back there the fake one
   gives itself away.

   The ring is built the same way: its two arcs are the avatar circle inset by half the stroke
   and the neighbour's grown circle, meeting exactly where the clip's arcs meet, so it hugs the
   cut outline instead of drawing a full circle that the cut then slices through. */

const SIZE = 64;
/** Fraction of the diameter each avatar sinks into the one before it. */
const OVERLAP = 0.25;
// Visible crescent between neighbours, px. Absolute rather than a fraction of SIZE: it reads as
// a hairline of daylight at any avatar size, and scaling it would turn it into a design element.
// Nudged up with the larger avatars only so the stripes behind still have room to show through.
const GAP = 3;
const RING_WIDTH = 1;
/** Centers the stroke so its outer edge sits exactly on the clipped outline. */
const RING_INSET = RING_WIDTH / 2;

const RADIUS = SIZE / 2;
const NEIGHBOUR_CX = RADIUS - SIZE * (1 - OVERLAP);
const CUT_RADIUS = RADIUS + GAP;

// The crescent eats the left of a clipped avatar, so its visible region's optical center sits
// right of the geometric one. Halfway toward the visible band's midpoint reads centered.
const CLIPPED_TEXT_SHIFT = (NEIGHBOUR_CX + CUT_RADIUS) / 4;

/** Stripe period measured perpendicular to the 45° bands. */
const STRIPE_PERIOD = 22;
// Sliding the layer sideways only shifts the pattern's phase by the component along the gradient
// axis, so a horizontal travel of period / sin(45°) lands exactly one stripe on. Anything else
// and the loop visibly jumps at the seam.
const STRIPE_TRAVEL = STRIPE_PERIOD * Math.SQRT2;

// Equal perceived brightness: every fill sits at L 0.52, well below both stripe tones, so the
// stack stays the foreground wherever it lands on the candy. Content artwork, so it stays
// outside the token palette.

                  Stripes rather than a gradient, because the job here is evidence, not decoration.
                  A gradient only proves the hole where its colour happens to differ from the
                  surface, so it has to be tuned until every part of it reads. A hard edge crossing

                  and come out the other, which a ring painted in the surface colour can never fake.

                  Candy stripe, so the panel stays friendly rather than looking like a debug
                  overlay. 22px period puts roughly two edges across each crescent, and both tones
                  sit well above the avatars' L 0.52 so the stack still reads as the foreground.
