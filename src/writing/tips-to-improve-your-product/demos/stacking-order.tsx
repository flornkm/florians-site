/* Figure for "Avoid z-index as much as possible" in the Unpopular tips article.
   The oldest bug in the book: a dropdown that opens *behind* the thing below it.

   `z-index` is the panel as most codebases have it. The toolbar sits at z-index 1, the content
   under it at z-index 2, and the menu carries a desperate 9999. The 9999 does nothing: a
   positioned element with a z-index starts its own stacking context, so the menu can only ever
   be the top layer *within the toolbar*, and the toolbar as a whole still loses to the content.
   No number typed into the menu can fix that, which is the point.

   `order` removes every z-index and moves the toolbar to the end of the list while the menu is
   open. Both panels are absolutely positioned off their own fixed offset rather than their index,
   so re-ordering the DOM changes which one paints on top and moves nothing on screen. */
