/* Figure for "Don't skip the active state" in the Unpopular tips article.

   One button and a dropdown that swaps what happens while it is held. Nothing else, because the
   entire subject is a single `:active` rule: there is no state to track, no gesture handler, no
   spring library. The dropdown only decides which class the button carries.

   Hover is here too, a step up where the press is a drop to near-black. The two have to be ranked,
   not merely different: hover says the cursor is over the target, the press says the target took
   the input, and if the hover is as loud as the press then arriving somewhere looks the same as
   doing something. Which is also the reason the press cannot be left out — on touch the hover
   step never happens at all, so a button without an active state gives its user nothing.

   The two press styles are the two honest answers, not a good one and a bad one. Scaling gives
   way under the finger and reads playful; a tonal shift stays exactly where it is and reads calm.
   Which one is right is a question about the brand, and "None" is there so the difference against
   nothing at all is available in the same control. */

// Near-black, and a true neutral: chroma zero rather than a cooled or warmed grey, so nothing in
// here competes with the page. One fill serves both themes, which is the reason it stops at 0.27
// instead of going to black — against this site's pure #000 dark page a black button would be a
// hole, and 0.27 clears it by more than the site's own cards clear it.
//
// Hover goes up rather than down: four points off near-black in the other direction is almost
// nothing to look at, so the lift is where the contrast is. The press then goes the opposite way
// and nearly all the way, which is what makes the two unmistakable rather than different — the
// button rises to meet the cursor and drops out from under the finger, and neither can be mistaken
// for the other at a glance. Rest sits at 0.27 rather than lower so the press has somewhere to
// travel to, and so one fill can serve both themes.
const BUTTON_FILL = "bg-[oklch(0.27_0_0)] text-white hover:bg-[oklch(0.31_0_0)]";

/* Depth from two layers, both inside the button, and no drop shadow at all. The fill has to stay
   a single animatable `background-color` for the press below, so none of this can be a gradient.

   1. Light along the top inside edge, blurred and fading down into the fill rather than drawn as
      a hard 1px line. The negative spread pushes the other three sides out of the box so the glow
      only exists where light would actually land, and the offset runs one px past it, which leaves
      a hairline of the glow at full strength on the top row with the blur carrying the rest down.
      Cancelling the two exactly instead puts the whole falloff on the boundary, and half of it
      then lands outside the button — the reason the first pass at this was invisible on a fill
      this dark. A hard line reads as a second border; this reads as a surface curving up to meet
      the light. Plain white rather than a tint, since the fill has no hue of its own to pick up,
      and dimmer in dark mode: the same white reads far hotter with a black page around it than
      with a white one, because the eye is judging it against everything else on screen.
   2. The edge, inset so it lands on the button's own pixels instead of adding a line outside it.
      Black on a light page, white at 15% on a dark one: the seam has to be the thing the surface
      is not, and against a near-black page a black rim would just be more page. Listed first,
      because the earlier layer in a box-shadow paints over the later ones — the rim sits on top
      and the light starts just inside it. Reversed, the highlight's brightest row would land on
      the rim and read as a dark line above its own glow.

   Keeping the elevation entirely internal is what stops the figure drifting off its subject. A
   drop shadow lifts the button off the page, and once it is floating the eye starts reading the
   distance rather than the press. */
