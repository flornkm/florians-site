  `# About Florian Kiem

Florian Kiem — Designer, Engineer.

Born in the south of Germany, I grew up with the Internet. In my childhood, I tried a bunch of different disciplines, ranging from 3D art to graphic design.

After studying product design, my day-to-day work evolved into something different. Pure Figma designs aren't enough, so I see my value in developing foundational design systems hands-on.

In the past, I've worked with companies like Rogo, Superpower, and Dash0. I also invest in some of the companies I work with.

Reach me on [X](https://x.com/flornkm) or via [email](mailto:hello@floriankiem.com).`,

The fastest way to reach me is email: hello@floriankiem.com. I read everything that lands there — questions about my work, advisory or embedded design-engineering collaborations, or just a hello.

If you are writing about a project, a short note on what you are building and where design or engineering help is needed makes it easy for me to respond quickly. I usually reply within a few days.
