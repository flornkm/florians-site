# Great typography

Good typography is mostly restraint. A sensible scale, comfortable spacing and enough contrast beat any clever effect. A label, a table cell, a marketing headline and an article paragraph should not share one set of rules. Apply these principles when building or reviewing anything with text in it.

**Match the project's styling system.** Before suggesting or writing any fix, check how the codebase styles things and express every change in that system: Tailwind utilities in a Tailwind project, plain declarations in CSS, CSS Modules, styled-components or StyleX. The [cheat sheet](css-cheat-sheet.md) maps each declaration to its Tailwind equivalent. Never introduce a second styling approach just to apply a typography fix.

## Core Principles

### 1. Serve the Right Format

Use `.woff2` (Brotli compression, broadly supported) on the web. `.woff` is a fallback only for very old browsers; `.ttf` and `.otf` are raw desktop formats with no web compression. How the files are loaded is the project's own concern, this skill does not prescribe it.

### 2. Properties Over Raw Tags

When a CSS property exists, use it. `font-weight: 650` instead of `font-variation-settings: "wght" 650`, `font-optical-sizing: auto` instead of `"opsz"`, `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` instead of `font-feature-settings: "tnum" 1`. Properties keep working when a non-variable fallback renders. Reserve the raw-tag properties for custom axes (`"GRAD" 80`) and niche features (`"ss01" 1`) that have no property of their own.

### 3. No Fake Weights

When a weight or style is not loaded, the browser synthesizes it. That is a safety mechanism, not a feature. Set `font-synthesis: none` so missing files fail visibly instead of rendering a faked bold or italic.

### 4. Fewer Fonts, Sizes and Weights

Rarely use more than three fonts. Weight and size define hierarchy, but overusing them hurts readability quickly. Pair for contrast, not similarity: a serif headline with a sans body reads as deliberate, two near-identical sans-serifs read as a mistake.

### 5. Use a Type Scale with Semantic Names

Define a small set of sizes and deviate from it as little as possible. Hard-coded sizes without a system break down at scale. For solo projects, default names like `text-sm` work fine as long as the usage rules are clear. On a team, name sizes by use (`text-body-sm`), not by size, so the rules stay consistent.

### 6. Heading Sizes Descend with Level

Map each heading level used on a page to a descending step of the type scale: a lower level must never render larger than a higher one on the same page. Adjacent levels may share a size toward the small end of the scale as long as weight or spacing keeps them distinct. Pick the tag from the document outline and control the size with CSS; never skip levels or reach for an `h4` because it "looks right".

### 7. Line-Height by Role

Headings tighter, around `1.1`. Body copy `1.5` to `1.6`. Prefer unitless values so line-height scales with the font size; fixed values like `24px` do not.

### 8. Letter-Spacing by Size

Large headings often look better with slightly negative letter-spacing. Small uppercase labels need a little positive letter-spacing so letters do not feel crowded. Body copy at reading sizes needs neither.

### 9. Cap the Measure

Long lines make it hard for the eye to find the next line. Cap long-form text around 60–75 characters per line. Any unit works: `65ch` measures characters directly, and a pixel or rem cap is just as good: at a `16px` body size the range lands roughly between `560px` and `680px` depending on the font, so Tailwind's `max-w-xl` or `max-w-2xl` fit. What matters is that a cap exists and the resulting line length sits in range.

### 10. Wrap Deliberately

`text-wrap: balance` distributes text evenly across lines: use it on headings. `text-wrap: pretty` avoids leaving a single short word on the final line: use it on descriptions. Skip both in long-form text: browsers ignore `balance` past a few lines anyway, and evening out a whole paragraph wastes space and makes it harder to read. `overflow-wrap: break-word` where long words, links or IDs could escape the container. `white-space: nowrap` on labels and badges where a line break looks broken.

### 11. Tabular Numbers on Changing Values

Digits have different widths by default, so timers, counters and prices shift layout as they update. Apply `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` to any value that changes.

### 12. Truncate Without Losing Content

Single line: `text-overflow: ellipsis` with `overflow: hidden` and `white-space: nowrap`. Multiple lines: `line-clamp`. Truncation hides content, so if the missing text matters, keep the full value reachable in a tooltip or expanded view.

### 13. Write Copy Naturally, Style with CSS

Store text in natural case and control presentation with `text-transform`, so redesigns never require rewriting copy. Use smart punctuation: curly quotes in prose (straight quotes in code), an en dash for ranges like `2010–2020`, an em dash to set off a thought, the single ellipsis character, `&nbsp;` to keep values like `16 px` together and `&shy;` to control where long words may break.

### 14. Underlines from the Font

Default underlines sit wherever the browser decides. Pull position and thickness from the font's own metrics with `text-underline-position: from-font` and `text-decoration-thickness: from-font`, or tune manually with `text-decoration-thickness`, `text-underline-offset` and `text-decoration-skip-ink`. `text-decoration-style` draws the line dotted, dashed or wavy; a dotted underline is a common hint that a word carries extra information, like an abbreviation or a defined term. Unless the only thing animating is a color change, build the underline as a separate element instead of using `text-decoration`: color is the only part of a real underline that animates reliably.

### 15. Inputs at 16px on Mobile

iOS Safari zooms the whole page when an input's text is smaller than `16px`. Keep input text at `16px` on mobile viewports (`text-base sm:text-sm`). Avoid the `maximum-scale=1` viewport meta: Safari ignores it for pinch zoom, but every other browser honors it and blocks zooming, which fails WCAG.

### 16. Size and Contrast Floors

Body text `16px` (the web default and the right reading size). UI text can go smaller: `14px` for inputs and menus (inputs still need `16px` on mobile, see principle 15), `13px` for captions, rarely below `12px`. WCAG AA: `4.5:1` contrast for regular text, `3:1` for large text (roughly `24px` and up).

### 17. Font Smoothing on the Root

On macOS text renders heavier than intended. Apply `-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased` and `-moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale` (both covered by Tailwind's `antialiased`) once on the root layout so they cover all text.

### 18. Logical Properties for Direction

To support right-to-left content, use direction-agnostic properties: `margin-inline-start` instead of `margin-left`, `text-align: start` instead of `left`. Set `lang` so browsers pick the right quotes and hyphenation, and `dir="rtl"` where needed.

### 19. Style the Selection, Disable It Where It Distracts

`::selection` is a subtle way to embed brand in the reading experience; keep the combination legible. Use `user-select: none` on button labels where copying is unlikely and selection feels distracting, and make sure `cmd+A` only grabs text the user expects to copy. In cross-platform apps that feel closer to native, disable selection for the interface and keep it only on content worth copying.

## Review Output Format

Always present changes as a markdown table with **Before** and **After** columns. Include every change you made, not just a subset. Never list findings as separate "Before:" / "After:" lines outside of a table. Group changes by principle using a heading above each table, and keep each row focused on a single diff. Write every **After** snippet in the styling system the project already uses.

### Example

#### Tabular numbers
| Before | After |
| --- | --- |
| `<span>{price}</span>` on live price | `<span className="tabular-nums">{price}</span>` |
| `font-feature-settings: "tnum" 1` | `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` |

#### Line-height and measure
| Before | After |
| --- | --- |
| `leading-none` on body paragraph | `leading-normal` (body needs `1.5`–`1.6`) |
| Full-width article column | `max-w-2xl` (~65 characters per line at `16px`) |

Rows should cite the specific file and property when it is not obvious from the snippet. If a principle was reviewed but nothing needed to change, omit that table entirely.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `.ttf`/`.otf` served on the web | Convert to `.woff2` |
| `font-variation-settings: "wght"` for weight | `font-weight` (works with non-variable fallbacks) |
| `font-feature-settings: "tnum" 1` | `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` |
| Browser-faked bold or italic | Load the file, set `font-synthesis: none` |
| Hard-coded one-off font sizes | Use the type scale |
| `h3` rendered larger than `h2` on the same page | Map heading levels to descending scale steps |
| Heading tag picked for its size, skipping levels | Level from the document outline, size via CSS |
| `line-height: 24px` on scalable text | Unitless value (`1.5`) |
| Full-width paragraphs | Cap around 60–75 characters per line |
| Orphan on the last line of a paragraph | `text-wrap: pretty` |
| Lopsided two-line heading | `text-wrap: balance` |
| Numbers cause layout shift | `tabular-nums` |
| Truncated text with no way to read it | Tooltip or expanded view for the full value |
| `UPPERCASE` typed into copy | Natural case + `text-transform` |
| Justified text in an interface | `text-align: start`; reserve justify for specific editorial layouts |
| Underline cuts through descenders | `text-decoration-skip-ink: auto`, `from-font` metrics |
| Inputs below `16px` zoom on iOS | `text-base sm:text-sm` |
| `margin-left` in RTL-capable UI | `margin-inline-start` |
| Selectable button labels in native-feel UI | `user-select: none`, keep selection on real content |
| Extra-info hint with no visual cue | Dotted underline via `text-decoration-style: dotted` |
| Tailwind classes dropped into a CSS-in-JS codebase (or the reverse) | Express the fix in the styling system the project already uses |
